      As Muslims committed to justice, we recognize that we live, learn, and worship on the unceded, unsurrendered territory of the Algonquin nation. We affirm our responsibility to support Indigenous self-determination and to work toward justice in word and deed.

        We remember the Qurâ€™anic call to stand firm for justice (4:135) and the Prophetic teachings against oppression. We ask God to help us uphold these commitments and to work in solidarity with the Algonquin people.
